# FinalProject
My final project is a multiplayer ping pong game that will help student relax and enjoy a good game of ping pong. To make this project possible I used two potentiameter, a bread board and jumper wires.The most challenge about this project was getting my Processing code to work, but after numerous research and debuging I was able to get my code to work. I choose this idea for project because I always wanted to create some form of a video game, and ping pong idea came to my thoughts and I just when with it.
